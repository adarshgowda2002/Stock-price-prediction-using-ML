# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the future stock prices of companies using Machine Learning models. It leverages historical stock data to forecast the closing price, helping traders and investors make data-driven decisions.

## 🔍 Overview

The project involves:
- Data collection from Yahoo Finance or Kaggle.
- Data preprocessing and visualization.
- Implementation of ML models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM.
- Evaluation of model performance.
- Interactive plot to compare actual vs predicted stock prices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (if LSTM used)
- yfinance (for stock data)
- Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit (optional for GUI)

## 📊 Features

- Predicts stock closing prices using ML models.
- Visualizes trends and model accuracy.
- Compares different model performances.
- (Optional) Streamlit app for interactive prediction.
